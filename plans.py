Adventure Hooks: How the Party Gets Involved
Passing Through Welton: The party encounters Welton as a waypoint on their journey to a larger adventure.
Village's Call for Help: An adventurer’s guild, NPC ally, or other local source informs the party of Welton’s generous 800gp reward for eradicating a dangerous wolf pack. The reward is notably large for a seemingly simple task, potentially intriguing or alarming the party.
Key Scenes
Scene 1: Welcome to the Welton Wolfpack
Ambush on the Road: Before reaching Welton, the party witnesses a wolf pack attacking shepherds and their flock. This can serve as an introductory combat or skill encounter.
Combat Details: Wolves aim to steal sheep and avoid killing humans. They will retreat if overwhelmed.
Post-Combat Interaction: The grateful shepherds share local gossip, hinting at strange wolf behavior and escalating attacks.
Shaggy Wolf Stories (Local Rumors):
Disappearing sheep and strange incidents tied to the wolves’ activities, such as:
Wolves seemingly opening locked barns.
Packs moving with supernatural coordination.
Survivors recounting unsettling encounters, such as wolves speaking or unnatural thunder in the woods.
Scene 2: Village People
Welton Overview: A modest farming community with wheat and sheep farming. Many villagers seem anxious and food supplies are precarious.
The Shepherd’s Crook Inn: The hub of activity, where villagers discuss the wolf problem. The innkeeper warmly welcomes adventurers and directs them to Willen Featherock, a traumatized survivor of a wolf ambush.
Council Meeting:
The council describes escalating wolf attacks, including coordinated ambushes and property damage.
Background is provided on Alexi Merriksonn, a missing sorcerer and brother to Father Merriksonn.
Potential leads include tracking wolves or setting bait. The council offers support like lodging and advice from Corel, an experienced shepherd.
Scene 3: Plan of Attack
Investigating the Wolves: The party must track the wolves to their den, either through tracking checks, baiting, or creative planning.
Optional Encounter - The Owlbear’s Picnic: A desperate owlbear, previously injured by wolves, attacks the party, providing foreshadowing of the wolves' power and intelligence.
Scene 4: The Den’s Denizens
Wolf Den Setup: A surprisingly organized cave system with wolves wearing decorations and guarding stolen sheep.
Encounter Options:
Combat: Wolves will defend their den aggressively, with Flame (chaotic leader) and Bolt (cautious strategist) leading them.
Stealth: The party can infiltrate using tripwire detection and creative approaches.
Social Interaction: Listening to Flame and Bolt’s argument reveals internal pack conflict about their next steps.
Scene 5: Inside the Cave
Cave Layout: Features include a nursery for wolf pups, a storeroom of stolen goods, and a meeting room for the pack’s leaders.
Potential Outcomes:
Combat: Wolves fight strategically, using Pack Tactics and their leaders' elemental breath weapons. Flame favors aggression, while Bolt focuses on defense.
Negotiation: Bolt explains their newfound intelligence came after encountering Alexi Merriksonn. He suggests peace, while Flame demands war.
If negotiations proceed, Flame attacks Bolt, leading to a split among the wolves.
Scene 6: Settling the Scores
Combat Resolution: If the party chooses to exterminate the wolves, they return to Welton for the reward. Survivors (especially pups) may beg for mercy.
Peaceful Resolution: Bolt proposes coexistence, offering to relocate the pack or guard the area in exchange for peace. The party must persuade the village council, navigating internal politics and making compelling arguments.
Aftermath:
Deception: If the party lies about eradicating the wolves, Father Merriksonn might confront them.
Community Impact: If peace is achieved, Featherock recovers mentally, and the village stabilizes.
