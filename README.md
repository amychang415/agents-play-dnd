# agents-play-dnd
AI agents made to play Dungeons and Dragons.

Created for Stanford CS 222, AI Agents and Simulations.

### Overview
Watch AI agents play a DnD campaign! Each agent will create three potential player characters, choose a character to play as, then embark on a DnD journey. After their campaign has ended, agents will be asked a series of post-game questions.

### Setup
Edit `plans.py` and `agents.py` to add your own campaign plans and player backgrounds. If you are running more than one campaign, edit `group_nums` in `main.py`.

### Use
Run `main.py`, and watch the campaign playout in the terminal!

### Evaluate
At the end of the campaign, your player's data and message log will be saved locally.
